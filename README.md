# oPlotSymbl - A LaTeX Package for Symbols for Scientific Plots

This package is named oPlotSymbl and it includes symbols, which are not easily available. Especially, these symbols are used in scientific plots, but the potential user is allowed to use in another way. 


## READ ME FIRST:

It exists a manual for this package. Please read this first. To install this LaTeX package manually, follow these steps (all steps are for my preferred LaTeX distribution „Tex Live“!):

### For installing on Windows 7 (and above): 

__Windows 7:__ C:\Users\<user name>\texmf\tex\latex\local\

I’m not able to test this for Windows 7 and especially for the new Windows 10. If this directory is wrong, it would be really nice to inform me! 

Perhaps it is necessary to reload LaTeX database which includes a list of all installed packages. To tell LaTeX/TeX Live that there is a new package, I would recommend this thread: 
<http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/20160/how-to-register-my-own-packages-or-classes-in-a-separate-drive-to-tex-live-insta>

### For installing on Mac (Mac OS X and macOS): 

__For Mac:__ /Users/<user name>/Library/texmf/tex/latex/local/

This should work for 10.9 and above. If not, then be so kind to inform me. As I know it is not necessary to reload database. It should work automatically after restart.

Thanks in advance for telling any problems to make this work even better!
